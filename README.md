LiveSplit.Quake2
=================

LiveSplit auto splitter for Quake2. Can also pause LiveSplits game timer while in loading screens.

Manual Installation
-------------------
Download "LiveSplit.Quake2.dll" and place it into the subdirectory "Components" of your LiveSplit folder. You can then add it to your layout (category "Control").

Usage
-----
Move the events that you would like the autosplitter to split on into the left list. The events are sorted by the order in which they occure. Keep in mind that you will have to setup your splits accordingly.
##### Pause game time
If you activate this option, the autosplitter will pause the game time when the game is loading, or in the main menu etc. This does not affect the realtime at all.
